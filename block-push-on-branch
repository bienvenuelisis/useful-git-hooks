# Things you need to do - 
# 1. Copy above code
# 2. Go to your project/.git/hooks
# 3. Copy pre-push.sample and rename it to pre-push
# 4. Paste the above code
# 5. Make this file executable - $ chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
# 6. Voila! Now you will see your push is failing in "master" branch
# 7. If you use Amazon Chime then create a webhook URL and replace the in cURL or add code which sends message to Slack or 
# your preferred communication channel
